                                A phishing attack is a type of cyber attack in which attackers use deceptive tactics to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal information. The term "phishing" is a play on the word "fishing," as attackers cast a wide net, hoping to lure unsuspecting users into providing valuable information.</p>

                          <h5 class="card-title">What Are the Types of Phishing Attacks?</h5>
                          <p class="card-text">Deceptive Phishing :Deceptive phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate a trustworthy entity or create a fake website to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal information.</p>
                          <p class="card-text">Spear Phishing :Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing attack where cybercriminals tailor their fraudulent messages to a specific individual, organization, or group. Unlike generic phishing attempts, spear phishing involves thorough research on the target to create personalized and convincing messages</p>
                          <p class="card-text">Whaling :Whaling is a specialized form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as executives or decision-makers. The goal of whaling attacks is to compromise the accounts of top-level employees, gaining access to sensitive company data or leveraging their positions to conduct further attacks.</p>
                          <p class="card-text">Pharming :Pharming is a cyber attack that involves redirecting the legitimate website traffic of users to a fraudulent website without their knowledge. Unlike phishing, which relies on tricking individuals to click on malicious links, pharming attacks manipulate the Domain Name System (DNS) or use other methods to redirect users to counterfeit websites. Once redirected, users may unwittingly provide sensitive information, believing they are interacting with a legitimate site.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">How Does a Phishing Attack Work?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">A phishing attack is usually a part of a large campaign, aiming to capture as many victims as possible in a big sample space of targets. Starting from its place of origin to the successful retrieval of credentials, a phishing attack consists of four independent phases that need to be executed. Let us learn more about each individual phase in detail, as denoted in the image below. </p>
                      </div>
                      <img class="card-img-bottom img-responsive" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/phishing_working_2-What_Is_Phishing.PNG" alt="Img">
                      <p class="card-text">Phase 1 :A malicious hacker sends an email or a message to the target, acting as a reputed source. More often than not, it asks the target to follow a third-party link for a security inspection or a simple feature update.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Phase 2 :The target thinks the email came from the mentioned sender, be it a bank or a company, and follows the malicious link to a counterfeit web page designed to look as similar as possible to an authentic website.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Phase 3 :On the fake website, the user is asked to submit some private information, like account credentials for a specific website. Once the details are submitted, all the information is sent to the hacker who designed the website and malicious email.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Phase 4 :On receiving the account credentials, the hacker is free to use them by logging in or selling consequent information retrieved on the internet to the highest bidder.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">How to Prevent Phishing Attacks?</h4>
                      </div>
                      <img class="card-img-bottom img-responsive" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/phishing_prevention.PNG" alt="Img">
                      <h4 class="card-title">Ways to Prevent</h4>
                      <p class="card-text">Email Authenticity :One must always cross-check the sender and contents of a sensitive email that asks for private information. Whether from the bank or a shopping website, checking the senderâ€™s address is the first step in protecting oneself. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">HTTPS Webpages :Users must try their best to stick to websites that have an HTTPS certification. Not only are they less likely to be phishing web pages, running network attacks on such secured websites is more challenging than usual. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Avoid Pop-Ups :One must avoid following random pop-ups that advertise games or enticing monetary rewards for clicking on them. Designed to dupe innocent users, these pop-ups are primarily used to inject malware into a target system or steal important credentials.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Password Rotation :You must change our passwords every few months to maintain the maximum security of our data. For example, even if some website successfully gets some credentials in a phishing attack, there is a solid chance the target must have already changed the compromised password.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Anti-Phishing Extensions :Many free anti-phishing extensions like Cloudphish and Netcraft scan your emails to check for known vulnerabilities that may lead to phishing attacks. Using such addons makes it easy to filter out most phishing emails without doing any manual work.</p>
